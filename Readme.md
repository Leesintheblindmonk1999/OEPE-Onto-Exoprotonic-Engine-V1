# 🔬 **Description:** 

OEPE (*Onto-Exoprotronic Engine*) is a hybrid semantic transformation and interpretative platform designed to process natural language inputs using an **expanded symbolic system of exoprotronic keys and emergent conceptual replacements**.

It offers:

- Contextual transformation of input text via advanced regex mapping.
- Symbolic enrichment based on exoprotronic keys.
- Integration with OpenAI API for meta-analysis and interpretative expansion.
- Web interface with user-selectable symbols, transformation levels, and feedback capabilities.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Semantic Transformation**
- Replaces keywords with detailed exoprotronic conceptual descriptions.

✅ **Exoprotronic Symbol Activation**
- Users can choose which symbols ("keys") to embed in the output.

✅ **Interpretative Feedback**
- Generates expanded analyses via OpenAI GPT models.

✅ **Interface Capabilities**
- Input console for text.
- Selection of transformation depth (`basic`, `medium`, `advanced`).
- Feedback form via Formspree.
- Download transformed outputs.
- Reset console session.

✅ **Transparent Logging**
- Logs user input and system processing steps.

## 🧭 Usage Guide

1️⃣ **Input Text**  
Type or paste your text into the input field.

2️⃣ **Select Transformation Level**
- `basic` (1 replacement max)  
- `medium` (3 replacements max)  
- `advanced` (all applicable replacements)

3️⃣ **Choose Active Symbols**  
Select which exoprotronic keys to activate.

4️⃣ **Process**  
OEPE will:
- Transform the text.  
- Annotate activated keys.  
- Generate an interpretative output via OpenAI.

5️⃣ **Feedback & Output**
- Send feedback via Formspree or local field.  
- Download your output.  
- Reset the console.  
- Feedback will be saved in `feedback_log.csv` if provided.
